I am not much sporty type but whenever I get a chance, I don't hesitate to try a new game.
Like all other fellow indians, I used to follow cricket like religion in my childhood. As I entered college, I have tried a couple of new games
like Table Tennis, Badminton, Swimming, Pool and Foosball. Just yesterday, we played Foosball for 3 straight hours.

And also, my most favourite carrom. We even wrote a AI based agent to play carrom on our behalf. See [here](https://github.com/meetshah1995/carrom-rl) for the code.
